# Doge OS

DogeOS is an extension of Life, an OS-like collection of software,
at times also defined an *application layer* or a *runtime environment*.

DogeOS components run on a variety of computing platforms:
blockchain networks, phones, tablets, laptops, workstations.

DogeOS components run on a large variety of operating systems.

DogeOS components running on blockchain networks can't
be taken down, thus making it, same as Life, an unstoppable,
uncensorable, undeletable OS-like collection of software.

The [Ur](
  ../ur)
and the [Ethereum Virtual Machine File System (EVMFS)](
  ../evmfs)
are core components of DogeOS.

DogeOS runs on many blockchains networks, some of which
use Dogecoin as their computational power currency.

DogeOS is made of thousands of distinct softwares,
of which the core ones are developed and authored by
[The Martian Company](
  ..) and it is
part of the Human Instrumentality Project (HIP).

DogeOS core components are released as free software under
the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.
