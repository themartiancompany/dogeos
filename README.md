# Doge OS

DogeOS is an extension of Life, an OS-like collection of software,
at times also defined an *application layer* or a *runtime environment*.

DogeOS components run on a variety of computing platforms:
blockchain networks, phones, tablets, laptops, workstations.

DogeOS components run on a large variety of operating systems.

DogeOS components running on blockchain networks can't
be taken down, thus making it, same as Life, an unstoppable,
uncensorable, undeletable OS-like collection of software.

The [Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
and the [Ethereum Virtual Machine File System (EVMFS)](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
are core components of DogeOS.

DogeOS runs on many blockchains networks, some of which
use Dogecoin as their computational power currency.

DogeOS is made of thousands of distinct softwares,
of which the core ones are developed and authored by
[The Martian Company](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany) and it is
part of the Human Instrumentality Project (HIP).

As of 2025 DogeOS sources and the Ur application store resources
are the largest object ever written on any blockchain, with a size
of over 6 gigabytes recorded through millions of transactions on more
than an hundred Ethereum-like blockchains.

### Build

A DogeOS system is one whose base packages have been
built from The Martian Company's recipes on the Ur.


### Name controversy

Having been working on DogeOS development for more than 4 years,
with many people from the 'Dogelon Mars' community well knowing
what the plans were, when the so-called 'MyDoge' developers
have shown to be working on a product with the same name and apparently
the same description, despite them not having even published one of the
needed technical tools needed to accomplish what this DogeOS has,
The Martian Company has futilely tried to contact them on X to
peacefully and cordially address this controversy, as it is
customary between civil, polite and good people.

Despite The Martian Company's efforts, after months of ignoring
its contacts requests, 'MyDoge' developers have
turned over time explicitly hostile, with its lead 'cb_designer'
and one of his developers even blocking The Martian Company's
contacts on social networks.

Considering there is yet another project called DogeOS, focusing
on yet another matter, supposedly having existed for over 10 years,
The Martian Company considers 'MyDoge' a bunch of savages and
thieves without any morals nor dignity and their actions
something appropriate for the kind of person they want to communicate
they are.

Overall, keeping in mind The Martian Company is the author of a
permissionless application store where multiple developers can publish
their own version of a certain application, it considers 'MyDoge'
actions a form of bullying which it hopes it will cause that
company to lose all credit it had and ultimately dismantle.
