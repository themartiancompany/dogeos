# Doge OS

DogeOS is an extension of Life, an OS-like collection of software.

DogeOS components run on a variety of computing platforms:
phones, tablets, laptops, workstations, blockchain networks. 

DogeOS components run on a large variety of operating systems.

The DogeOS components running on blockchain networks can't
be stopped until those networks stop running.

The DogeOS components running on blockchain networks can't
be taken down, thus making it, same as Life, an unstoppable,
uncensorable, undeletable OS-like collection of software.
